# voterblock/core

This project is an exploration into a blockchain based approach into decentralized voting. Mainly created this to learn more about how blockchains are implemented.

The main logic is located within src/types/blockchain.rs, and contains mechanisms to cast and tally votes to ballots in a cryptographically secure and anonymized way, along with some unit tests.

src/main.rs contains some code for prototyping and testing purposes.
